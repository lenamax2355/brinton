This package includes three functions to perform graphical exploratory data analysis. 

+ `wideplot()` presents a matrix of graphics that show the structure of a dataset; 
+ `longplot()` presents a vector of suitable graphics from one variable of a dataset and 
+ `showplot()` presents a specific graphic from one variable of a dataset. 

Future work will include the hability to draw longplots and showplots from a selection of a limited number of variables within a dataset.

## Installation

You can install the released version of brinton from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r installation}
# install.packages("brinton")
```

And then load the functions included in the package:
```{r load}
library(brinton)
```


## Example

When a new dataset comes up, R users use to call the `str()` function that describes textually the main characteristics of this dataset. The new `wideplot()` function does the same but graphically. As an example, just uncomment and run:

```{r wideplot}
# wideplot(infert)
```

This function includes the argument `dataclass` that sets the types of variables to be included in the matrix as well as the order in which they are listed. As an example, the following line should plot only the numeric variables included in the iris dataset:
```{r}
# wideplot(infert, dataclass = c("numeric"))
```


Although, the `wideplot()` function shows only a small set of the graphics suitable for each type of data. If the user wants to see all the available graphics for some specific variable included in the dataset, then the `longplot()` is useful. As an example, just uncomment and run:
```{r}
# longplot(infert, "pooled.stratum")
```

Any of the graphics presented in the `longplot()` output can also be presented. If one wants to compare the output of some other specific graphics one can, for instance, run:
```{r}
# wideplot(infert, 
#          dataclass = c("numeric"), 
#          numeric = c("point graph", "binned point graph", "binned heatmap"), 
#          label = TRUE)
```

Sometimes, specially with character variables, there is not enought space for the graphic area, and the user may want to increase the width of the columns in the matrix. The user can then modify the defalut value of the `ncol` argument:
```{r}
# wideplot(infert,
#          dataclass = c("numeric"),
#          numeric = c("point graph", "binned point graph", "binned heatmap"),
#          label = TRUE,
#          ncol = 3)
```

If the user is interested in one particular graphic, then the function `showplot()` is useful. 
```{r showplot}
# showplot(infert, "pooled.stratum", "color binned stripe graph")
```

The default output is still a html file but, the `showplot()` function allows also to plot the graphic in the plots pane or the console:
```{r plotspane, out.width = '40%'}
showplot(infert, "pooled.stratum", "color binned stripe graph", output = "plots pane")
```

```{r console}
showplot(infert, "pooled.stratum", "color binned stripe graph", output = "console")
```
