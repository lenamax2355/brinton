There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. Just one NOTE
concerning the possibly mis-spelled words in "EDA".

Acronyms have been deleted.

Examples are now simpler in order to speed up the 
outputs.

Arguments have been added in order to write the 
examples/vignettes/tests to tempdir() by default.

We would like to thank the helpful revision that 
Swetlana Herbrandt have provided.
